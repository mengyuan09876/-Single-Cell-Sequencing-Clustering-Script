# -Single-Cell-Sequencing-Clustering-Script
This script is designed to process single-cell sequencing data by reading multiple FASTA files, combining them, aligning the sequences, calculating a similarity matrix, performing clustering, and saving the results. The script uses Clustal Omega for sequence alignment and scikit-learn for clustering.
